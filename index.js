In a groundbreaking move, a U.S. TV provider has recently incurred the first-ever fine related to space debris violations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took action against the company for non-compliance with regulations governing the proper disposal of a satellite. This unprecedented event emphasizes the increasing significance of responsible practices in space activities.

Space debris, also known as space junk, poses a growing concern as human activities in space escalate. The FCC's decision to impose a fine underlines the importance of adhering to guidelines that mitigate the creation of additional space debris and promote the safe management of existing objects in orbit.

This historic fine sets a precedent for accountability in the space industry, encouraging companies and entities to adopt measures that prioritize the sustainable use of Earth's orbital environment. It reinforces the need for stringent oversight to ensure that satellites and other objects are deorbited or moved to safer orbits at the end of their operational lives, contributing to the long-term sustainability of space activities. As humanity continues to explore and utilize space, such

Simple Calculator:
Create a basic calculator that can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can take input from the user and display the result.

Temperature Converter:
Build a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Allow the user to input the temperature and the scale, and then output the converted temperature.

BMI Calculator:
Develop a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. Take the user's height and weight as input and calculate their BMI using the formula: BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m))^2.

Basic Quiz Game:
Create a simple quiz game where the user is asked a series of questions. Keep track of their score and provide feedback at the end.

Guess the Number:
Implement a game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" after each guess.

Text-based Adventure Game:
Build a simple text-based adventure game where the user makes choices to navigate through a story. Use variables to keep track of the user's progress.
